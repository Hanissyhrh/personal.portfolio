Anything that we want, they will make it come true. <br> For my youngest sister, she is everything to me. Many people said that we are twins, but actually we are not. We share almost everything together including our clothes and shawls. Well, thats not the best part of having a sister but other things, its fine.  She is the joker, the doctor, the enemy and everything well you just named it. She knows how to cheer me up, but sometimes she can be so annoying. No matter what happen, she is the best thing that ever happen in my life. </font></b></p>
